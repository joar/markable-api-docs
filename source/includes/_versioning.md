# Versioning

The platform behind **Markable Lens API** is continuesly being improved for stability, accuracy, and new features. We may introduce changes with bugs, so to minimize the impact for our integrated users/partners the API will be versioned.

Currently the API is in **private beta** and the versioning process is not being implemented, but as soon as we move into **public beta** the versioning will be in place.
