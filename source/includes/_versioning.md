# Versioning

The platform behind **Markable Lens API** is continuesly improved to ensure stability, while at the same time developing the platform to reach higher accuracy and more/better features to stay at the very edgy of our field. For this to be possible we may introduce breaking changes, but to minimize negative impact for our integrated users/partners the ambition is that the API will be versioned.

Currently the API is in **private beta** and so the versioning process is being implemented, but as soon as we move into **public beta** the versioning will be in place.
